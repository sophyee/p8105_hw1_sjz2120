# Problem 1

## Loading the `penguins` dataset

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the
behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

Use the code below to download the a package containing the penguins
dataset:

``` r
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Next, use the following code to load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

penguins
```

## **Describing the penguins dataset**

Write a short description of the `penguins` dataset (not the
`penguins_raw` dataset) using inline R code.

-   There are a total of **344 rows/entries** in the `penguins` dataset
    and a **total of 8 variables**:

    -   **3 factor variables:** `Species`, `Island`, `Sex`
    -   **5 numeric variables:** `Bill Length (in mm)`,
        `Bill Depth (in mm)`, `Flipper Length (in mm)`,
        `Body Mass (in g)`, and `Year`.

-   The dataset contains **344 rows (observations)** and **8 columns
    (variables)**.

-   The mean flipper length among penguins in this dataset is
    **200.9152047 mm**.

## Creating a scatterplot for \`penguins’ dataset

Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x), using
color points for the species variable:

``` r
##Create scatterplot of flipper length (y) vs bill length (x)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + xlab("Bill Length (mm)") + ylab("Flipper Length (mm)") + ggtitle("Plot of Penguin Flipper vs Bill Length (by species)")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

![](p8105_hw1_sjz2120_files/figure-gfm/penguins_flipper_bill_scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

Export the scatterplot to the project directory using ggsave:

``` r
##Save scatterplot to project directory
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Problem 2

## Creating a dataframe

Create a data frame comprised of: \* a random sample of size 10 from a
standard Normal distribution \* a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0 \* a character vector of
length 10 \* a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor
“levels”

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  rand_samp_10 = rnorm(10),
  greater_zero = c(rand_samp_10 > 0),
  char_vec_10 = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor_10 = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "medium","high", "high", "low", "low", "medium", "high"))
)
```

## Taking the means

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, rand_samp_10))
```

    ## [1] 0.8194255

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, greater_zero))
```

    ## [1] 0.8

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, char_vec_10))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, char_vec_10)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor_10))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor_10)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We’re able to take the mean of variables `rand_samp_10` and
`greater_zero` because they are **numeric and logical variable types**
(respectively), meaning that their values can be represented numerically
(when taking the mean for logical variable types they are treated as
TRUE=1 and FALSE=0, so we can take the mean of these 1s and 0s).

However, we’re unable to take the mean of variables `char_vec_10` and
`vec_factor_10` because they are character and factor variable types
(respectively). Since neither of them in their current forms are able to
be represented as numbers, we can’t take the mean of these variables.

## Applying `as.numeric`

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, greater_zero))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, char_vec_10))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor_10))
```

For the logical variable `greater_zero`, the FALSE values are recoded as
0 while the TRUE values are recoded as 1 (thus the variable becomes
numeric).

For the character variable `char_vec_10`, all of the values become
**NA** because there is no way to recode the character values
numerically.

For the factor variable `vec_factor_10`, the three different levels are
recoded as numbers. In this case, “high” was recoded as 1, “medium” was
recoded as 3, and “low” was recoded as 2.

This helps explain what happens when we try to take the mean of each of
these non-numeric variables. For the logical variable `greater_zero`,
we’re able to take the mean because FALSE=0 and TRUE=1 (they can already
be considered numbers). However, for `char_vec_10` and `vec_factor_10`
we are unable to take their means because their values are not numeric;
and only `vec_factor_10` can be converted to a numeric variable after
using as.numeric.
